| 001 | [Gemini OAuth](plans/001-gemini-oauth.md) | Ready | Google OAuth device flow for Gemini authentication |

## Plan Structure

Each plan follows this format:

1. **Prerequisites** - What you need before starting
2. **Phases** - Sequential implementation phases
3. **Tasks** - Specific actions within each phase
4. **Commits** - When and what to commit
5. **Validation** - How to verify the implementation

## How to Use

1. Read the plan completely before starting
2. Complete Phase 0 (Discovery) first if present
3. Follow tasks in order within each phase
4. Run validation commands after each task
5. Commit at the end of each phase
6. Push after final validation
